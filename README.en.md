A small tool that can "improve work efficiency". Wish you all a happy work!

>  *** Moderate entertainments is beneficial, addiction to entertainments is harmful.。***



## Ⅰ.Usage Scenarios

Feeling tired at work and taking a break to fun is not too much!! Just do it in moderation!! It can be hung anywhere on the screen very inconspicuously. You can read novels, books, or even memos anytime you want.

Or when loading web pages, compiling code, and other documents...you can read freely!

Especially when using a browser, placing it in the lower left corner really looks like a URL 😂 I have been using it for a few days and often forget that it's even there...

Currently supports window locking, window top setting, transparency adjustment, and custom background and text colors!

   >
   > The left arrow key or up arrow key turns the page backward;
   >
   > You can adjust the position and size to your liking! Lock the window after adjustment~
   >
   > After setting `置顶窗口`, it will always stay on top!
   >
   > You can adjust the background color, font color, and transparency in `样式设置`.
   >
   > When the program is closed, it will automatically record the reading progress, window position, window style, and other settings. (It will not be saved if the process is terminated directly.)

## IV. Code Explanation

The code is very simple, and basically has comments. It shouldn't need too much explanation, right?

Too lazy to write, go fun~
